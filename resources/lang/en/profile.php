Our fleet of necessary equipment and in-house production capabilities enable us to handle projects of any complexity. Pipeline rehabilitation using the cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) method can be performed even in winter with the right approach and conditions, which is crucial for projects not limited by seasonal constraints. We operate throughout Kazakhstan year-round.',
